# DiplomacyBot
Discord bot made to track the status of diplomacy

Will update in the channel named diplomacy once a turn went through.
If players are not set to anonymous then discord users can subscribe to a certain player, the bot will let you know if you still need to make your turn

Can show a leaderboard and order the results with the different value
